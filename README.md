# patched-spigot-fernflower

Fork of [Spigot's decompiler](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/fernflower/) for building Paper.
This is not the main decompiler Paper uses, but the decompiler used to generate sources for applying CraftBukkit and Spigot patches.

## Notice
This decompiler is **NOT** meant for general use, see [Forgeflower](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeFlower), [Vineflower](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower), [CFR](https://www.benf.org/other/cfr/), etc. for maintained decompilers
which will produce much better output than this. The purpose of this decompiler is to produce output close enough or identical to that of Spigot's decompiler so that CraftBukkit and Spigot
patches will apply cleanly, but to do it faster. This means it is not a goal of this decompiler to improve output, unlike the aforementioend projects.
